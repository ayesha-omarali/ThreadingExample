# ThreadingExample
This is an example of basic threading. 

I instantiate a class that holds a number, n seconds, and increment. 
Every given n seconds, it updates the number to itself multiplied by the increment
I only print if the number has been incremented. 

In main, I instantiate two threads, and run them. Here my sample inputs are done so you can clearly tell the difference because of the decimal
